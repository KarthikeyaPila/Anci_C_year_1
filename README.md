All the questions of the book ANCI C by E.Balagurusamy were completed.
the initial questions might not be that clear and might be a bit disorganised (because i was just getting into programing back then lol)
but questions from the chapter 11 are perfectly organaized and maintained. (atleast that's what i think haha)
