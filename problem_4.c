 write a C program that reads the value of distance travelled by a car and the time taken for the same.
Next, compute the speed at which the car travelled.
int main(){
    int reading1;
    int reading2;
    int distance = reading2 - reading1;
    int time;
    printf("what was the reading before you started the journey? ");
    scanf("%d" , &reading1);
    printf("what is the current reading? ");
    scanf("%d", reading2);
    printf("you travelled: %d" , distance);
}
